---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

**Implementation:**
- Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- Email/password authentication (auto-confirm enabled for development)
- Secure password storage (bcrypt hashing)
- Session management with refresh tokens

**Security Measures:**
- Password requirements: Minimum 8 characters
- Email verification (production)
- Rate limiting on login attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Session timeout (7 days)
- Secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)

### 2. Row-Level Security (RLS)

**Database Policies:**
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Users can only SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE their own data
- Policies: `auth.uid() = user_id` check on all operations
- Public read-only access for suppliers table
- No direct access to auth.users table

**Example Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own business plans"
ON business_plans FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Client-Side:**
- Zod schema validation for all forms
- File type validation (images: JPEG/PNG/WebP, audio: WebM/MP3)
- File size limits (images: 5MB, audio: 5MB)
- Input length restrictions (text: 2000 chars, voice: 2 mins)

**Server-Side (Edge Functions):**
- Re-validation of all inputs
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries via Supabase client)
- XSS prevention (input sanitization)
- Content Security Policy headers

### 4. API Security

**Edge Functions:**
- CORS headers configured appropriately
- JWT verification for authenticated endpoints
- Rate limiting per user (100 requests/hour per endpoint)
- Request body size limits (10MB max)

**Third-Party APIs:**
- API keys stored in Supabase secrets (never in code)
- Server-side API calls only (keys never exposed to client)
- Error handling without exposing sensitive details

### 5. Data Privacy

**Compliance:**
- GDPR considerations for EU users
- Data minimization (collect only necessary data)
- User data export capability (JSON format)
- Account deletion with cascading data removal

**Storage:**
- Encrypted at rest (PostgreSQL native encryption)
- Encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
- No logging of sensitive user content
- Automatic backup retention (7 days)

### 6. File Upload Security

**Measures:**
- File type verification (magic number checking, not just extension)
- Virus scanning (future enhancement)
- Unique filename generation (UUID-based)
- Storage bucket access policies (private by default)
- CDN-served files with signed URLs (expiration: 1 hour)

### 7. AI Content Safety

**Considerations:**
- Content moderation for generated text (profanity filtering)
- Prompt injection prevention (input sanitization before AI calls)
- Rate limiting on AI endpoints (10 requests/hour for expensive operations)
- Monitoring for abuse patterns

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: AI Generation Quality & Consistency

**Problem:**
- AI-generated content may be generic, inconsistent, or not India-specific
- Users may receive incomplete or irrelevant business plans
- Voice transcription accuracy varies by accent/language

**Solutions:**
- **Detailed Prompt Engineering:** Create comprehensive, structured prompts with India-specific context
- **Iterative Refinement:** Allow users to regenerate sections with additional input
- **Template-Based Structure:** Use JSON schemas to enforce consistent output format
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** If AI fails, provide template-based content with placeholders
- **Quality Assurance:** Implement minimum content length checks (300+ words per section)
- **User Feedback Loop:** Collect ratings on generated content to improve prompts over time

**Monitoring:**
- Track completion rates of business plan generation
- Monitor average content length per section
- Analyze user regeneration frequency

---

### Challenge 2: Multi-Language Support & Accuracy

**Problem:**
- 10+ Indian languages with diverse scripts and dialects
- Translation accuracy varies by language pair
- Context and cultural nuances may be lost in translation

**Solutions:**
- **Primary Language Strategy:** Focus on English + top 3 languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu) initially
- **Gradual Expansion:** Add languages based on user demand and testing
- **Hybrid Approach:** 
  - Accept voice input in any language
  - Transcribe to native language first
  - Translate to English for AI processing
  - Keep original transcription for user reference
- **Language Detection:** Use AI to auto-detect language (GPT-5 Nano)
- **User Confirmation:** Show detected language and allow manual override
- **Native Speakers Testing:** Partner with native speakers for quality assurance

**Metrics:**
- Language detection accuracy (target: >95%)
- Translation quality scores (manual review)
- User satisfaction by language

---

### Challenge 3: Financial Calculator Complexity

**Problem:**
- Users may not understand financial terms (break-even, LTV, margins)
- Inaccurate inputs lead to unrealistic projections
- Over-simplification may not satisfy investors

**Solutions:**
- **Guided Inputs:** 
  - Tooltips explaining each field
  - Example values for reference
  - Industry benchmarks (e.g., "Average retail markup: 50-100%")
- **Input Validation:**

### Challenge 5: Google Maps API Costs

**Problem:**
- Google Maps API pricing can escalate with high usage
- Each map load, place search, and directions request costs money
- Unlimited user access may exceed budget

**Solutions:**
- **Optimization:**

  - Batch place requests (single query for multiple dealers)
- **Usage Limits:**
  - Rate limiting per user (5 map searches per day for free tier)
  - Premium tier with unlimited maps access
- **Alternative Sources:**
  - Use OpenStreetMap for non-critical features
  - Pre-fetch and store dealer coordinates (reduce real-time API calls)
- **Cost Monitoring:**
  - Set daily budget limits in Google Cloud
  - Alert when approaching 80% of monthly quota
  - Analytics to identify high-usage users

**Projected Costs:**
- Map loads: $7 per 1,000 loads
- Place searches: $17 per 1,000 searches
- Directions: $5 per 1,000 requests
- Target: <$500/month for 10,000 active users

**Problem:**
- AI generation (business plans, logos) takes 30-60 seconds

**Solutions:**
- **AI Response Time:**
  - Streaming responses (show content as it's generated)
  - Queue system for high-load periods
  - Progress indicators with estimated time
  - Async processing with email notification for long operations
- **Database Optimization:**
  - Indexing on frequently queried columns (user_id, created_at)
  - Pagination for list views (20 items per page)
  - Database query optimization (avoid N+1 queries)
  - Connection pooling (Supabase manages this)
- **Frontend Performance:**
  - Code splitting (load routes on demand)
  - Image lazy loading and compression
  - CDN for static assets
  - Service worker caching for offline access
- **Caching Strategy:**
  - Cache AI-generated content in database (avoid regeneration)
  - Browser caching for images (7-day expiration)
  - Edge function response caching (Supabase CDN)

**Metrics:**
- Time to first byte (TTFB): <500ms
- Largest contentful paint (LCP): <2.5s
