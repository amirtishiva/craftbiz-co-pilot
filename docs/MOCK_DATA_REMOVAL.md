# Mock Data Removal Documentation

## Overview
All hardcoded and mock data has been systematically removed from the CraftBiz application and replaced with real-time database queries and live API integrations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Statistics (src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx)
**Before:** Hardcoded stats showing static values ('1', '0', '0', '0')
**After:** Real-time data from Supabase database via `useDashboardStats` hook

**Implementation:**
- Created `src/hooks/useDashboardStats.ts` - Fetches real counts from:
  - `business_ideas` table
  - `business_plans` table
  - `design_assets` table
  - `marketing_content` table
- Stats now update dynamically based on user's actual data
- Added loading state with spinner

### 2. Suppliers Directory (src/components/suppliers/SuppliersList.tsx)
**Before:** Already fetching from Supabase database
**After:** No changes needed - already using live data

**Current Implementation:**
- Fetches suppliers from `suppliers` table on mount
- Applies real-time filtering by category, city, and search query
- Shows actual supplier count in stats grid

### 3. Local Dealers Map (src/components/suppliers/LocalDealersMap.tsx)
**Before:** Already using Google Maps APIs
**After:** No mock data found - fully integrated with:
- Google Places API for nearby search
- Distance Matrix API for distance calculations
- Directions API for navigation
- All dealer data comes from real-time Google Places searches

### 4. Design Studio (src/components/design/DesignStudio.tsx)
**Before:** Mock logos and scenes generated with placeholder data
**After:** Real AI-generated content stored in database

**Implementation:**
- Created `src/hooks/useDesignAssets.ts` - Fetches user's design assets
- Integrated with `generate-logo` edge function
- Saves generated logos/scenes to `design_assets` table
- Shows only user-created assets from database
- Added loading states and error handling

### 5. Marketing Hub (src/components/marketing/MarketingHub.tsx)
**Before:** Mock social media posts with hardcoded content
**After:** Real AI-generated content stored in database

**Implementation:**
- Created `src/hooks/useMarketingContent.ts` - Fetches user's marketing content
- Integrated with `generate-marketing-content` edge function
- Saves generated content to `marketing_content` table
- Shows only user-created content from database
- Added loading states and error handling

### 6. Business Plans (src/components/business/BusinessPlan.tsx)
**Before:** Already using database for storage
**After:** No changes needed - already using live data from `business_plans` table

### 7. Idea Capture (src/components/idea/IdeaCapture.tsx)
**Before:** Already using database for storage
**After:** No changes needed - already using live data from `business_ideas` table

## New Custom Hooks Created

### useDashboardStats.ts
```typescript
// Fetches real-time counts for dashboard statistics
- business_ideas count
- business_plans count
- design_assets count
- marketing_content count
```

### useDesignAssets.ts
```typescript
// Fetches user's design assets (logos, scenes)
- Filters by user_id
- Orders by created_at (newest first)
- Returns loading state
```

### useMarketingContent.ts
```typescript
// Fetches user's marketing content
- Filters by user_id
- Orders by created_at (newest first)
- Returns loading state
```

## Data Flow

### Before (Mock Data):
```
Component → Hardcoded Arrays → Display
```

### After (Live Data):
```
Component → Custom Hook → Supabase Query → Display
User Action → Edge Function → AI API → Supabase Insert → Update Hook → Display
```

## API Integration Status

### Fully Integrated (No Mock Data):
✅ Google Maps JavaScript API (LocalDealersMap)
✅ Google Places API (LocalDealersMap)
✅ Google Distance Matrix API (LocalDealersMap)
✅ Google Directions API (LocalDealersMap)
✅ Supabase Database (All CRUD operations)
✅ Supabase Edge Functions (AI processing)

### Edge Functions Using Live AI:
✅ `generate-logo` - Uses Lovable AI for logo generation
✅ `generate-marketing-content` - Uses Lovable AI for content creation
✅ `generate-business-plan` - Uses Lovable AI for business plan generation
✅ `refine-idea` - Uses Lovable AI for idea refinement
✅ `transcribe-voice` - Uses Lovable AI for voice transcription
✅ `analyze-product-image` - Uses Lovable AI for image analysis

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Dashboard Stats:**
   - Create a business idea → Verify "Ideas Analyzed" count increases
   - Generate a business plan → Verify "Plans Generated" count increases
   - Create a design → Verify "Designs Created" count increases
   - Generate marketing content → Verify "Marketing Assets" count increases

2. **Suppliers Directory:**
   - Search for suppliers → Should show results from database
   - Filter by category/city → Should update results dynamically
   - No suppliers case → Should show "No Suppliers Found" message

3. **Local Dealers Map:**
   - Allow location access → Should show user's location
   - Search for dealers → Should show real nearby businesses from Google Places
   - Click directions → Should open Google Maps with route
   - Change radius → Should update search results

4. **Design Studio:**
   - Generate logo → Should call AI and save to database
   - Generate scene → Should call AI and save to database
   - Refresh page → Should load previously generated assets
   - Empty state → Should show "No assets" message

5. **Marketing Hub:**
   - Generate content → Should call AI and save to database
   - Copy content → Should copy to clipboard
   - Refresh page → Should load previously generated content
   - Empty state → Should show "No content" message

## Security Considerations

All data queries are filtered by `user_id` using RLS policies:
- Users can only see their own ideas, plans, designs, and marketing content
- Suppliers table is publicly readable (as per business requirements)
- All write operations require authentication

## Performance Optimizations

1. Custom hooks cache data in component state
2. Loading states prevent UI flickering
3. Database queries use indexes on `user_id` and `created_at`
4. Google Maps APIs are called only when needed
5. Edge functions handle AI processing server-side

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement real-time subscriptions for collaborative features
2. Add pagination for large datasets
3. Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
4. Add optimistic UI updates for better UX
5. Implement background sync for offline support
